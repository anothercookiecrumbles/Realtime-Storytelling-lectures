# lecture 2 - calculating rate

The aim of thie session is to explre some methods for calculating the rate of a stream of data. Specifically we will:

* learn about the poisson process
* consider two ways to measure the rate of a stream
* implement a windowed moving average

Our schedule will look like:

* go over the basics of the poisson process
* write a quick script to simulate a poisson process
* talk about how to measure a stream's rate

BREAK

* talk about stream processing patterns
* meet `redis`
* implement a time-diff stream
* implement a moving average
